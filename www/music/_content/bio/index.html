<h1>Bio</h1>
<h2>One-liner</h2>
<p>Vinyl DJ since 2008, forged in the raw energy of dark drum and bass and his techstep mix series, now diving into the depths of techno and electro as a resident at Willa in Łódź.</p>
<h2>Short</h2>
<p>Collecting vinyl since 2008, I debuted on the scene in 2010 with a sound rooted in dark and raw drum and bass. After a series of techstep mixes, I released my final dnb set in 2016 for NFSOP. I co-hosted the TechBreak radio show on <a href="http://break.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break.fm</a>, a project dedicated to late 90s and early 2000s techstep. Since then, my style has evolved toward slower tempos, exploring techno, electro, and related genres always anchored by the authenticity of vinyl. Currently, I’m a resident DJ at Willa in Łódź, refining my craft with every set.</p>
<h2>Extended</h2>
<p>Collecting vinyl records since 2008, I made my debut on the scene in 2010. My early years were rooted in dark, raw sounds - neurofunk, technoid, amen breaks - culminating in techstep drum and bass. My love for drum and bass runs deep, dating back to the late '90s, and it shaped my approach to music selection. I’ve always sought out lesser-known artists, a hallmark of my mixes for those who take the time to listen.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2013, together with DJ Still, I co-hosted a radio show called TechBreak on  <a href="http://break.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break.fm</a>, an online station born from the legacy of the legendary Polish drum and bass forum <a href="http://dnb.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dnb.pl</a>. The show aired every other Tuesday for a year, spanning 23 episodes that highlighted the raw, dark energy of late 90s and early 2000s techstep and drum and bass. We invited Polish DJs devoted to that sound, creating a platform where underground selectors could share their passion. The full archive of TechBreak remains available at  <a href="http://mixcloud.com/techbreak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mixcloud.com/techbreak</a>, a time capsule of that uncompromising era.</p>
<p>In 2016, I released my final drum and bass mix as a podcast for Neurofunk Society of Poland (<a href="http://youtube.com/@nfsop3511" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youtube.com/@nfsop3511</a>). As time passed, my musical tastes matured, leading to a slower tempo and an exploration of techno, electro, and similar genres. My mixes, still infused with the same fervor and energy, are now characterized by intricate and nuanced rhythms, yet always anchored by the timeless appeal of vinyl records.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m a resident DJ at Willa in Łódź, continuing to refine my craft with every set.</p>
