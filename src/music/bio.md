<p>Collecting vinyl records since 2008, I made my debut on the scene in 2010. My early years were rooted in dark, raw sounds - neurofunk, technoid, amen breaks - culminating in techstep drum and bass. My love for drum and bass runs deep, dating back to the late '90s, and it shaped my approach to music selection. I’ve always sought out lesser-known artists, a hallmark of my mixes for those who take the time to listen.</p>
<p>In 2016, I released my final drum and bass mix as a podcast for NFSOP. As time passed, my musical tastes matured, leading to a slower tempo and an exploration of techno, electro, and similar genres. My mixes, still infused with the same fervor and energy, are now characterized by intricate and nuanced rhythms, yet always anchored by the timeless appeal of vinyl records.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m a resident DJ at Willa in Łódź, continuing to refine my craft with every set.</p>
